# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview of the Project
This project was to help customers who are looking to vacation find an ideal location based on temperature and weather conditions. The customer is able to select the temperature they would like get a world map of many locations fitting the criteria. They can narrow it down and create a travel itinerary between locations, when they have chosen a preferred city they then have access to a hotel and the descriptive weather data. 
### Purpose
To use an API to pull real time data for customers looking to vacation based on ideal temperature. 

## Resources
 - data source: OpenWeatherMapAPI, Google Maps and Places API Software: Python 3.6.1, Jupyter Notebook, Gmaps 
 
## Results
The vacation that was planned, had a nice cool temperature between 50 and 65 degrees Farhenheit. There were several close locations on the Southern side of Africa. Four cities were chosen, and each will display a hotel in the area, the current temperature, and the current weather description. This code can be refactored many times, whether it be picking new latitudes and logitudes around the globe, selecting a differnt temperature range, a new set of cities, or creation of an itinerary. The choice of cities will be the area of coding that likely needs some refactoring so input can be selected on a computer interface rather than put into the code manually. 

## Summary
This project gave access to real time weather and map data, and allowed us to build an interactive map. It gave us access to API keys and the use of which keeps the data fresh and up to date.
